# Activities

## Researched FASTAI

Read through the first five chapter of the FASTAI book.  Took most notes on Chapter 2 because I followed the code in that chapter for the first CNN.  In addition to learning FASTAI, I spent some time getting caught up with the Raycasting-Simulation repository, figuring out how the simulation worked. 

## Deep Learning

Trained two CNNs on a small dataset of left, right, and straight images generated from the AutoGen.py file. 

1. The first CNN was trained on more data
	-   maze.txt AutoGen run
		-   looks like it gets stuck in last step? (resolved thanks to Jared)
		-   saved 5202 in straight, 318 in left, and 384 in right images on first run
		-   AutoGen finished running after second run
			-   816 in straight, 155 in left, 228 in right
	-   new_maze.txt AutoGen run
		-   finished running and added 585 images to straight, 101 to left, and 38 in right (I think that makes sense actually because new_maze only had one WEST direction)?
	-   Then wrote a small code chunk based on Prof. Clark's example from Imitate.py, which inputs an observation into the learner and predicts the robot's movement
		-   The GIF reveals that the robot stays in the same spot, turning left and right forever
Here is the animation from the first CNN:

2. The Second CNN:
	-   saved about 4157 images in straight, which has the most compared to left and right
	-   This time I utilized Jared's updated code but still found that the robot never moves out of its starting location
This is the animation for the second CNN:

# Issues

- The initial CNNs trained off 3330 images did not predict robot movement well. The animations reveal that the robot stays in place.
- Git issue: Accidentally modified RaycastWorld/RaycastWorld.h and consequently a git pull will involve a merge conflict. Unfortunately, I already committed afterwards and pushed. 

# Plans

My main plain for the upcoming week is to:
- Continue going through the FASTAI course
- Look into seeing if I am predicting correctly (see Imitate.py more)
- Generate more data
	- Will need to create more mazes and run Jared's AutoGen.py code
- See how to revert a commit for a single file so that I can submit a pull request without any merge conflicts

# Activities

## Unreal Simulation Automator

- Discovered that certain mazes mess up the automator
    - Also realized that in the UE coordinate system, the bot passes through the origin which could suggest a better way to update the pose when moving from right to left

- Fixed a bug where the unreal engine wouldn't update pose. 

# Issues

- A couple mazes cause the automator to stutter

# Plan

- Focus on fixing this bug

### Imitate

- Worked more on imitate plotting
- Added scatter plots which plot steps taken as a funtion of trainig/valid loss
- Added boxplots which plot steps taken as a function of mazes
- Successfully ran and plotted a 10 maze test on the uniform models

# Issues

- 95% confidence intervals look wonky after a 10 maze test

# Plan

- Ask Prof Clark ideal bar plot diagrams
- Read more Pandas documentation and examples to work more efficiently

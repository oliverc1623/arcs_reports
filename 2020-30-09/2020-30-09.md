# Activities

## Electronics

- Started working on the robot from this summer. Spent most of my time remembering how the robot worked. 
- Wrote some documentation on the robot. Added a new [README](https://github.com/oliverc1623/raycasting-simulation/tree/master/Robot) to the raycasting simulation repository. 
- Motors still work on Motion Studio

# Issues

- Default Python in the jetson is not the Mambaforge environment version. So running scripts keep returning no package errors
- Robo_claw package still not completely installed

# Plan

- Keep adding to documentation, especially material like powering the roboclaw, battery specifics, and Python in the jetson
- Create some alias so that running roboclaw scripts calls the mabaforge python with all the packages 
- Learn how to manually install robo_claw package

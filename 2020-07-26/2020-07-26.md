### Imitate

- Made major changes to Imitator now that we are plotting four model replicates
- Started with changing the default arguments for the models, making each of them
standard classification, non-advanced models
- Next, I took the results and made them into a data frame with Pandas
    - this will help with plotting and data mamipulation

# Issues

- Converting a python dict to pandas data frame posed some structural issues
- Difficult to determine the best data frame shape for plotting

# Plan

- Ask Prof Clark ideal bar plot diagrams
- Read more Pandas documentation and examples to work more efficiently

# Process
You will complete a "Self-SWOT" (see below), and either add it to your lab report or send me a DM on Slack. Don't go to far overboard, I don't want you to spend more than 10 to 20 minutes on this. I will also consider each question for you. We will then take a lab meeting for me to meet with each of you one-on-one. This will be a fairly informal process and the goal is to improve me as a mentor, you as a mentee, and the lab in general.
We will create a meeting schedule when the day draws near.
# SWOT

Strengths:

- Made a seemingly robust model. In other words: Optimistic 
- Flexible: took on multiple tasks with different purposes such as a making a different dataset,
regression, and Unreal Engine work

Weaknesses:

- Taking too long on tasks:
    - When I get stuck on a problem, I get hung up and don't ask for help 
    - E.g. in the angle regression task, I spent a lot of time figuring out the  
    angle I'd write to the image file
- Not very knowledgeable on the underlying mechanics of a neural network: 
    - I could learn more about neural nets to make a direct impact on the other models
    - A lot of my work has been dataset prep, loss func, and regression
- Could definitely communicate more with Christy
    - It would benefit the lab if I ask Christy more about the NN she's been working on and
    learn more about her work

Opportunities:

- FastAI: an excellent source that I know I can utilize more
- Courses: CS152
- Goals: Make a robust model that can work well in the Unreal Engine and hopefully apply the model to a robot

Threats:

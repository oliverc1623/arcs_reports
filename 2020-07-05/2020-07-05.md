## FasiAI Deep Learning

### Regression Model

- Built a working regression model
- Model predicts turn angle instead of an action command
- Image file names include the angle degrees, not radians

The image above shows how I'm calculating the angle we are writing in the file name

What is turning_angle? Turning angle is the sum of sequential turns, each turn adding 2.5 degrees

How are we predicting? 
```python
num_movements = abs(int(pred_angle / 20))
```
We divide the predicted angle by 20. This means high predicted angles will induce more turn moves, while low turn predictions will be 0, straight. Note: the 20 is the rounded down from 22.9, the squareroot of 525, which is also the lowest MSE during training.

### Different Loss Function

- Tried a new loss function based on the Open Bot paper: 
$$L = MSE(s^t, s^p) + MSE(a^t, a^p)$$, where $s$ is the steering angle and $a$ is the action, represented as 0=left, 1=straight, 2=right. 

Initial Diagnostics

Note that the model (blue) with the new loss function was trained on 11,000 images, while the regression model (orange) was trained on over 300,000 images. 

### Imitator
- Fixed up a bunch of bugs likes boxplots, video output, and frame counting
- Included a count-step plot
- Imitator works with regression, stacked, and classification models

# Issues
- I'm still a little confused on 180 deg bounds
- Loss function might be redundant - in fact, I misread the paper 
- Could clean up useless code within the two regression and classification Imitator files
- Need to follow up with Christy on inputs for the command input model.

# Plan
- Communicate with Christy on the Imitator file
- Included a bias and weight for the angle loss function. In other words, follow the open bot paper more closely
- Make standardized datasets to compare the different models

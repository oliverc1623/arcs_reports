# Activities

## Unreal Simulation Automator

- Ran the automator on 17/20 of the mazes. Three mazes caused the automator to get stuck but made sure to stop collecting images once it stopped 
- Collected about 

## Deep Learning

- Trained a pretrained Alex and ResNet34 on the dataset for 8 epochs.
- The ResNet34 model showed similar results to the CS152 version

# Issues

- Automator is still buggy 

# Plan

- Make a robust imitator
- Assess the current two models
- Train other models?

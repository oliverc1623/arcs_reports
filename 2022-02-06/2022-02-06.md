# Activities

## Unreal Simulation

- Worked on adjusting the Automator file so data collection is better
- Switched from working over SSH to working locally
    - The automator runs much faster
    - Also switched to VS code for debugging purposes

# Issues

- The server cannot import unrealcv, even though it worked last fall
- Automator is still buggy in Unreal. For example, it is still prone to wall clipping

# Plan

- Fix up Automator so that it works bug-free in Unreal
- Start training a few best-performing models from the summer and evaluate their 
    - This includes writing a Python script that will automate this process like the summer model training

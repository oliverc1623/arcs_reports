## FasiAI Deep Learning

- Got started on collecting data for a regression model

The plot above, shows the angles the Automator took while traversing the maze. 

### Building a Perturbed Dataset

Attached is a video showing the Perturb Automator going throw the maze, collecting images. Currently, I have the automator randomly shift left/right and orientate itself by an additional degree. 


Later, I trained a model using a dataset that contained shifted images only. This resulted in a model that had very low error rates but performed poorly on other mazes.

Moreover, the perturb automator created an even more imbalanced dataset. 

# Issues

The biggest issue I had this weak was adding perturbing angles.

The image attached reveals a sample error of what happens when I modify the angle. I think the source of this issue is that calling sin/cos on floats repetitively is causing the original direction angle to change by a very small factor. As a result, the automator will get stuck and turn forever. 

# Plans

- Solve the perturbing angle problem and create perturbed datasets. 
- Get starting on making regression models with the angle data

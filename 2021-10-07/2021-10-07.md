# Activities

## Electronics

- Got motors to work programmatically on the Jetson. Had to use a micro USB cable instead of jumper wire. This made it easier to find which serial ports was being used
- Made alias for running robot python scripts using the correct version. Type 'rrun' to run robot related scripts that use the roboclaw package
- Figured out roboclaw package. We don't need the entire roboclaw folder for a single script. Instead we just need 'robo_claw3.py' in the same directory wherever we're are writing code

# Issues

- SSH isn't working. Need to remember how to get SSH working so that a remote computer connects to the Jetson host
- Batteries are starting to decrease in voltage. Curious to know at which voltage I should stop using them. 

# Plan

- Look up previous documentation to help with SSH
- Help Christy on summer paper more

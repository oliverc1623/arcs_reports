# Activities

## Unreal Simulation Automator

- Continued adapting unreal to raycast automaor
- Discovered I have fundamentally updating the robot pose incorrectly
- Added functionality similar to RaycastWorld.h but still needs work

# Issues

- Flipped coordinate system in Unreal is causing incorrect turns
- Unsure of how raycast updates turning

# Plan

- I anticipate finishing the automator by next week, I'm optimistic changing how I
update the pose will make the automator work again
- Focus on adapting functionality from RaycastWorld.h
- Ask Jared and Prof Clark for help
- Start training a few best-performing models from the summer and evaluate their after data collection
    - This includes writing a Python script that will automate this process like the summer model training

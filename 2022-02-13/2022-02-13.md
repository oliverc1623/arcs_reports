# Activities

## Unreal Simulation Automator

- Still working on the Automator
- Fixed a bug in the turning function by adding another if-else condition
    - fixing this (may have) revealed a new issue with stepping forward

# Issues

- `dist_to_wall()` calculates distance far beyond reason which is why the bot will run through walls
- I speculate this has something to due with the coordinates being different

# Plan

- Focus on `dist_to_wall()` function, especially the `solve_triangle()` function
- Ask Jared to help
- Start training a few best-performing models from the summer and evaluate their after data collection
    - This includes writing a Python script that will automate this process like the summer model training
